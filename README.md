## Introduction

this prodjekt ames to make a robot arm that sorts lego bricks based on the color of the brick

## Getting started

Install the micropython package to your computer and connect to the robot arm. Upplod the code.py program to the robot

## Building and running

The main branch of the project will sort the lego bricks by itself. The off branc needs manual input through the buttons on the hub peace. The side buttons moves the arm and the middle one sets a position for pickup and dropoff zones.

## Features

Lastly, you should write which of the user stories you did and didn't develop in this project, in the form of a checklist. Like this:

- [x] US01: As a customer, I want the robot to pick up items from a designated position
- [x] US02: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at a designated position.
- [x] US03: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to determine if an item is present at a given location.
- [x] US04B: As a customer, I want the robot to tell me the color of an item at a designated position
- [x] US05: As a customer, I want the robot to drop items off at different locations based on the color of the item.
- [x] US06: As a customer, I want the robot to be able to pick up items from elevated positions.
- [x] US08B As a customer, I want to be able to calibrate items with three different colors and drop the items off at specific drop-off zones based on color.
- [x] US09: As a customer, I want the robot to check the pickup location periodically to see if a new item has arrived.
- [x] US10: As a customer, I want the robots to sort items at a specific time.
- [ ] US11: As a customer, I want two robots to communicate and work together on items sorting without colliding with each other.
- [x] US12: As a customer, I want to be able to manually set the locations and heights of one pick-up zone and two drop-off zones. (Implemented either by manually dragging the arm to a position or using buttons)
